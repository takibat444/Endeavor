## Description 
Our app offers a secure, easy-to-use platform where immigrants can digitally store all their important documents, such as IDs, resumes, medical records, and important documents so they no longer have to rely on keeping physical copies. In addition to document storage, the app connects users to ways to seek help through a network of trusted NGOs. It also includes features that allow users to track important dates and locate affordable hospitals. By bringing these tools together in one place, our app aims to help immigrants stay organized, informed, and better supported as they build their lives in New York City.

Users information isn't uploaded on a firebase, ensuring that any documents or information only lies on their phone only.
